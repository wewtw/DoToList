# DoToList app.
This is a small todo list app that takes in an input and saves it to the list that can be later removed. 
The styles are custom not the most beautiful but get the job done.
<p>Roadmap: while I have made it look simple it should be resposive and render well on most devices. Color and forms can be adjusted to look nicer</p>
