# DoToList app.
https://wewtw.github.io/DoToList/
<h3>This is a small todo list app that takes in an input and saves it to the list that can be later removed.</h3> 
The styles are custom not the most beautiful but get the job done. I made the forms and other elements into different colors so its easy to tell where to look at and not too flushy so its easy on the eyes. 
<p>Roadmap: while I have made it look simple it should be resposive and render well on most devices. Color and forms can be adjusted to look nicer</p>
